#Sample code

This is a sample code, which will evolve by the time. Worked time on it `8 hour`

#Requirements

For this page to run, you need npm, and node.js on your computer

#Easy setup

After you get npm, and node, you just need the command:

`npm install`

What until the npm is finished then you can start the application

#Start

To start the application you need to start the servers and the application.
For that you need the next 3 npm script in this order.

`npm run login-server`

`npm run backend-server`

`npm start`

With these steps the mock login backend is available at port `localhost:3001`

The backend at port `localhost:3000`

And the application on port `localhost:4200`

The application stores the backend data, such as login and issue, in the json files in the backend folder. For the first time to login you need to register.

#Future

The style will be better. So much better.

Redux will be built in.

It will develop with me.
